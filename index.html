      <h2>HISTORY</h2>
      <p>Thor Odinson is the Norse God of Thunder, known for his immense strength, bravery, and loyalty. As the son of Odin, the All-Father, and Frigga, Thor is the rightful heir to the throne of Asgard. He is a fierce warrior who has fought in countless battles to protect both his home realm and the universe.</p>
      <p>Wielding his enchanted hammer, Mjolnir, Thor can summon lightning, fly, and manipulate weather. His strength is unmatched, and his heart is noble. Even after losing his hammer, he proved himself worthy by creating and wielding Stormbreaker, a powerful axe forged in the heart of a dying star.</p>
      <p>In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Thor is portrayed by Chris Hemsworth. Over the years, he evolves from a brash warrior to a wise and self-aware leader. His journey spans battles across realms, personal loss, and self-discovery. He remains a core member of the Avengers and a protector of all realms.</p>
